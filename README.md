> [!NOTE]
> The company "Smart Games" specializes in the digital adaptation of abstract combinatorial strategy games. They now want to develop the game "Yinsh" designed by Kris Burm and marketed in physical form by Huch & Friends. To do this, it launched a call for tenders to entrust this project to a subcontractor.
>
>Your team is therefore competing to win this contract.
>
>You must develop a desktop version of this game, and not a web application or one using web technologies, which must run on the three main current systems, Linux, Windows and Mac OS graphic of your choice, such as Python & Tkinter or C & SDL. No-code technologies are prohibited.
>
>The graphic charter of the original game is very minimalist, you will also have to propose new decorations to make your solution attractive.
